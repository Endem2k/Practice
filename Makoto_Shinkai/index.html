					Some months later in June 2000, Shinkai was inspired to begin Voices of a Distant Star by drawing a picture of a girl in a cockpit grasping a cell phone. Some time later, he was contacted by Mangazoo, who offered to "work with him," giving him a grant to turn his idea into an anime they could sell. In May 2001, he quit his job at Falcom and began to work on Voices. In an interview, Shinkai noted that production took around seven months of "real work."

					In 2002 he released <span class="light_blue">The Voices of a Distant Star (Hoshi no Koe)</span>, which became his first short movie shown in theaters. Since both movies were made almost all by himself, their high quality surprised the viewers.

							Shinkai's next project was 5 Centimeters per Second. The first part streamed on Yahoo! Japan to Yahoo! Premium members from 16 to 19 February 2007. On 3 March 2007, the full-length film had its theatrical premiere at Cinema Rise in Shibuya, Tokyo. The film consists of three segments: "Cherry Blossom" (Ōkashō), "Cosmonaut" (Kosumonauto), and "5 Centimeters per Second" (Byōsoku Go Senchimētoru)
						</p>
						<p class="slider-text-content__content indent">
							Shinkai tried to reveal the basis, a kind of "universal law", universal for any life - and created a work where the main characters are time and distance. Here every frame, every segment of the plot is devoted to the four dimensions in their everyday, all-powerful habitual existence. A nontrivial poetic task: to pick up such metaphors and images that the viewer could pass through himself every second of life of heroes, every centimeter of the way passed by them - and keeping originality of history, to make it close and authentic.

						<p class="slider-text-content__content indent">
							The story is set in Japan, beginning in the 1990s up until the present day (2008), with each act centered on a boy named Takaki Tōno. The first act takes place during a time when cell phones are uncommon and email had not yet reached the general population.

							Takaki tono quickly became friends with Akari Shinohara when she transferred to his elementary school. The two of them became close, thanks to common interests and Hobbies. As a result, they formed a close bond: they talk to each other using their given names without any form of deference, which is extremely unusual in Japan, even among people who are romantically inclined to each other. This fact is lost in the process of translation into English and other languages, which greatly reduces the implied closeness of their relationship.

							After graduating from elementary school, Akari moves to Tochigi. The two keep in touch through correspondence, but despite the feelings they have for each other, they inevitably begin to distance themselves.

							In the film, Shinkai demonstrates the fascinating city plans, which in everyday life do not pay due attention .

							In 1999, Takaki is now in the third year of senior high in Tanegashima, where the Tanegashima Space Center is located. Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has been in love with him ever since meeting him in junior high school but has never had the courage to confess her feelings. She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant to Kanae's feelings and only treats her as a good friend. Kanae observes that Takaki is always writing emails to someone or staring off into the distance as if searching for something far away.

							A distinctive feature of Shikai's work is getting awesome graphics: realistic urban landscapes and endless skies in which float the texture of the clouds and bright burning stars. At the same time, the artist presents accessible and penetrating stories against the background of the painted landscape.

							In the work of Makoto Shinkai, the train is an additional character. Material manifestation of the cosmic forces ruling in the human world. He can separate heroes or, on the contrary, connect them, become a silent interlocutor or a messenger of inexorable fate. Today, Tokyo and Nagano are connected by the Hokuriku Shinkansen high-speed rail line, which opened in 1997. The new line allows you to get from one city to another in just an hour and a half. However, in Sinkai's films we see the leisurely commuter trains of his student youth. Let not so fast and high-tech, but much more attractive to the romantic nature of the young animator.

							In the third and final short, Takaki never finds spiritual peace, life seems meaningless to Him. He meets his young love, but only for a moment, after which the girl disappears again.

							Trains are the only time when Makoto Shinkai resorts to the help of 3D graphics, which does not stand out much from the General background of the picture.
