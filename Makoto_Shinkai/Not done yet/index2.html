									Shinkai's next project was 5 Centimeters per Second. The first part streamed on Yahoo! Japan to Yahoo! Premium members from 16 to 19 February 2007. On 3 March 2007, the full-length film had its theatrical premiere at Cinema Rise in Shibuya, Tokyo. The film consists of three segments: "Cherry Blossom" (Ōkashō), "Cosmonaut" (Kosumonauto), and "5 Centimeters per Second" (Byōsoku Go Senchimētoru)

									Shinkai tried to reveal the basis, a kind of "universal law", universal for any life - and created a work where the main characters are time and distance. Here every frame, every segment of the plot is devoted to the four dimensions in their everyday, all-powerful habitual existence. A nontrivial poetic task: to pick up such metaphors and images that the viewer could pass through himself every second of life of heroes, every centimeter of the way passed by them - and keeping originality of history, to make it close and authentic.

									The story is set in Japan, beginning in the 1990s up until the present day (2008), with each act centered on a boy named Takaki Tōno. The first act takes place during a time when cell phones are uncommon and email had not yet reached the general population.

She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant to Kanae's feelings and only treats her as a good friend.
